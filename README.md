# Traffic-Light-Detection-and-Recognition-Image-Processing
# Problem Definition:-
Given a captured image from street. and Using ONLY Image Processing Techniques and Algorithms, The application should detect if there is any traffic lights and recognize its state (red, green, and blue)

# Minimum Requirements
1. Detect from one frontal view traffic light.
2. Recognize the state of the traffic light.
3. Traffic lights may be close or far from the camera.
# Solution Architechture

# Testing 
- Case1: Frontal view near traffic sign with simple background
- Case2: Frontal view near traffic sign with complex background
- Case3: Frontal view far traffic sign with simple background
- Case4: Frontal view far traffic sign with simple background
